This project is created for the Huff Huffathon

The first implementation is verifying BLS signatures and aggregating public keys. The idea is one can verify that a collection of public keys aggregates to the public key checked against a signed message.

Read `LibBLSVerify.huff` for information on the different types of BLS that can be used, and the one chosen for this project. Due to this choice, we cannot compute the message hash on-chain, and therefore we pass the message hash as `signed_point`, as message hashing just maps a message to a curve point
